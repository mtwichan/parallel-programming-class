# Parallel Programming Class
A 4th year parallel programming computer science class

## Introduction
In this repository you can find the assignments and answers to a parallel programming class I took in my
final year of university. The class had us focus on parallel progamming in `C` using the CPU (openMP, PThreads), GPU (CUDA) and distributed computing.


## Offical Class Synopsis
```
Design and implementation of parallel programs including theoretical computer models, 
parallel architectures (distributed, multicore, GPU), and standard parallel libraries.
